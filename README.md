#SMACKTune Repo
This repo is being repurposed temporarily to allow for collaboration with other SMACK team members until we find a final resting place for these smack benchmarking configuration scripts.
The functionality here has been moved into main SMACK repo, now.

##Subprojects
* `tune` - Contains the original contents of this project, which is a parameter tuning framework for SMACK.
* `bench` - Contains the newly added SMACKBench configuration scripts and such.
